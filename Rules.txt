Rules
The player is placed in a maze made up of high-voltage fences and posts. There are also some interceptor robots that
will try to destroy the player. If the player touches the maze or any of these robots, that is the end of the game (and
the player!). The robots are also destroyed when they touch the fences/posts or when they collide with each other.
Every time the player moves in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a contiguous cell, each robot
moves one cell closer to the new player's location, in whichever direction is the shortest path. The robots have no
vision sensors but they have an accurate odour sensor that allows them to follow the player!
There is one hope: make the robots hit the maze or each other. If all of them are destroyed, the player wins. 


1)The player can only move to one of the 8 neighbour cells of his/her current cell;
  To move to each one of those cells you can do as follows:

  Q     W     E
  A   player  D
  Z     X     C

  You also have the option to stay in your current position by typing "S".

2)You aren't allowed to move to cells that are occupied by destroyed robots;

3)You can read the elements in the maze as follows:

  + = Non-electrified post;
  * = Electrical fence or post;
  H = You(alive);
  h = You(dead);
  R = Robot(alive);
  r = Robot(destroyed);
  O = exit gate;

4)If the robots hit either type of posts they get destroyed, they also get destroyed if they hit each other;

5)You can exit the game at any moment by typing CTRL-Z, in Windows, or CTRL-D, in Linux;

6)Have fun! :)
